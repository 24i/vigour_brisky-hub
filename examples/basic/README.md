#Basic example
Test multiple scenarios, combine them as you may need.
As of now the hubs do not support reconnection so servers need to be running before starting up of clients

**Server**

`node examples/basic/` 

**Client to server**

`node examples/basic/originClient` 

**DuplexServer client to server (Client and server)**

`node examples/basic/both` 

**Duplex client**

`node examples/basic/client`
